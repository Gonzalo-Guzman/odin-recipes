        <h2>Vegan Sushi</h2>
        
        <p>Sushi is probably my favorite food on the planet, and if had the choice I would eat it everyday. My gilfriend is vegan so I decided to look up this delicious plant based recipe for her. Y+G</p>
        
        <h3>What's in this vegan sushi:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Firm/extra firm tofu- That's pressed and then cut into thin strips before being sauteed to add a nice crispy crust to it. You could add in uncooked tofu as well if you want to make this extra quick and easy.
                Tempeh or other plant-based proteins are also good options here!</li>
            <li>Cucumber</li>
            <li>Carrot</li>
            <li>Rice- Rice that I got from Whole Foods specifically labeled as “sushi rice” which is really just short grain rice. Short grain rice is what is most traditionally used in sushi. I DID give this a try, just for the sake of it, with long grain rice and it did NOT work out well at all. I’ve even seen people do this with quinoa and cauliflower rice although I have never tried either of those :)</li>
            <li>Nori sheets– you can find these at most grocery stores and they’re relatively inexpensive! If all else fails, you can most certainly find them on amazon.</li>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Optional cream cheese– I didn’t use this in the sushi that you see in my photos/ video but I have tried it in place of the tofu and LOVE it. There are lots of delicious store bought vegan cream cheeses on the market now and I love it in sushi.</li>
            <li>Other ideas– bell pepper, tempeh, radish, sprouts, sesame seeds, pickled onions and cucumber, red onion, jalapeno and so much more! If you have a favorite sushi filling, please let me know!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cup of uncooked sushi rice*</li>
            <li>¼ cup of soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of cornstarch</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon of grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of oil (love toasted sesame oil in this recipe!)</li>
            <li>1/2 block (~8 ounces) of extra firm tofu, pressed and cut into 1/2 inch long strips (see photos and video for reference)*</li>
            <li>1 large (or 2 small) carrot, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ of a cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 Avocado, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>5–6 Nori sheets</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook your rice according to package instructions. Once done, place in a large bowl in the fridge to cool down.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce by whisking together the soy sauce, maple syrup, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, and water. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large non-stick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Once hot, add in the tofu and saute for 5 minutes untouched. Once it has formed a nice crust, flip and cook for a few more minutes on each side, about 12 minutes total. Add in the sauce and cook for a few more minutes, tossing often, so that the sauce can thicken. Stir to ensure the tofu is evenly coated in the sauce. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once rice is cooled down, mix in the rice vinegar and white wine vinegar and set aside.</li>
            <li>Assemble the sushi by placing a nori sheet on a sushi mat*. Spread 2/3 cup of the cooked rice over the nori sheet, leaving about 2/3 of an inch clean on one end (see video).  Top with some of the cucumber, 2 pieces of the tofu, carrots, and 2 slices of avocado. Roll the nori sheet over top of the fillings and continue to gently and *tightly* roll the sheet until it’s all the way rolled up. Repeat will the remaining ingredients (I end up with 5-6 rolls depending on how I filled them).</li>
            <li>Slice into 1 inch pieces and ENJOY! I LOVE mine with a little sliced ginger and a touch of soy sauce.</li>
        </ol>
